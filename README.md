## Contents
- `sampleData-2021_01_26`: A folder containing .mat files of sorted spike times
- `emapxxx.mat`: .maat files containing multi-electrode array maps
- `csd_analysis.m`: main matlan code to do Current-source density analysis. The rest of the matlab files are helper functions to load and process the data.
